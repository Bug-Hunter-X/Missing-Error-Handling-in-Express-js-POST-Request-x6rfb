# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for POST requests. The provided `bug.js` file shows an example of a server that accepts user data but lacks proper checks for missing or invalid data.  The `bugSolution.js` file shows a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

## Bug Description:

The server logs the user data from a POST request to `/user` but fails to handle scenarios where `req.body` is empty or contains unexpected data. This can result in application crashes or inconsistent behavior.

## How to Reproduce:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install Express.js.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/user` with a missing or invalid JSON body using a tool like Postman or curl. Observe the lack of error handling and potential crashes.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the improved version with error handling.

## Solution:

The solution involves adding robust error handling to validate the incoming request body before processing it. The corrected code includes checks for missing fields and data type validation to prevent unexpected errors.
